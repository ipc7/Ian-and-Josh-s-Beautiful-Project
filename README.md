# Ian-and-Josh-s-Beautiful-Project

We will be modelling orbiting bodies in three dimensions. The difficult part will be making code that can model such systems in the general case of N bodies. Reasonably with our limited computational power we don't expect to be modelling systems of more than N=20. Once we finish this we can start looking at many different systems. We would like to at least model our solar system, a stable binary star system, and perihelion precession. We could also investigate what happens when a body enters the system on a parabolic trajectory. The precession models will be our main focus. We would like to move beyond matplotlib and actually have animated models as well.


#Core Goals:
*model in 3d
*simple set up code
*animation
-celebrate with interesting models
*precession modeling
